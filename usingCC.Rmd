## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

cc(0.5, 5, 0.2, 3)

stoden = runif(10, min=0,max=1)
T = seq(from=1, to=10)

cc(gmax=0.5, LAI=3, stoden=stoden, Tair=T)

res=as.data.frame(cbind(stoden,T))
res$cc = cc(gmax=0.5, LAI=3, stoden=stoden, Tair=T)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
