# Rstudio

Rstudio will be the primary data analysis and visualization software that you will use for the course

To install follow the instructions:

<https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>.

# Github and Rstudio

To link Rstudio and our version control software (Git), you need to first create a GitHub account, and then configure your computer to understand/interact with git
and then finally link it with R studio

To do this: follow these instructions - get as far as creating a new project - for now leave the project empty; but make sure you create with a git repository

<https://www.r-bloggers.com/rstudio-and-github/>

If you are using a newer version of MacOS, you may also need to install X-quartz so that R can open graphics windows on the fly

<https://www.xquartz.org/>

You will need to re-start R 

# Install Packages
load some libraries that are likely to be useful

```{r install-packages, eval=F}
# Run this chunk only once in your Console
# Do not evaluate when knitting Rmarkdown

# list of packages
pkgs = c(
  'readr',        # read csv
  'readxl',       # read xls
  'dplyr',        # data frame manipulation
  'tidyr',        # data tidying
  'ggplot2')      # graphics package
    

# install packages if not found
for (p in pkgs){
  if (!require(p, character.only=T)){
    install.packages(p)
  
  }
}
```

# Programming in R

You have 3 options for writing R code

*  directly type into the console (temporary)
*  open an R script file (can be saved to git), useful for writing functions; next class!
*  **add as a R module in an R Markdown file** (can be saved to git), helpful for documenting and presenting your work; I'm using an R Markdown file here





# Simple example
You will first need to download clim.txt from ; and move it to your working directory - the directory you created when you made your first project in Rstudio. 

Now use the following R code to read that file in to R and do some basic analysis. Play with it a little and try different plots, aggregations, communting different variables.

You man need to set your working directory to the project directory

```{r readingexample, include=TRUE}

# useful library for data clean up, manipulation, formating
library(dplyr)

# reading in text data; there are many other functions #that can be used to read other data types
clim = read.table("data/clim.txt", sep=",", header=T)

# clim is now a data frame; one of the most commonly used object types in R; it is like a matrix but can have a mixture of different data types 
# see what columns are, look at first few lines
head(clim)

# or just the names
names(clim)

# or add to a new window (need dplyr library for this)
View(clim)


# to access a particular column use $ or column number

head(clim$tmax)

# to get a particular column and row, i.e rainfall on 5th day
clim$rain[5]

#or everything on the 10th day
clim[10,]

#first 5 rows of several columns
clim[1:5, c("tmax","tmin","month")]

# the 'c' denotes a vector in R
city = c("Jerusalem","Tel Aviv","Tsfat")
estheight = c(500,10,1000)

# you can combine vectors into a data frame
siteinfo = as.data.frame(cbind(city,estheight))
siteinfo

# you can subset
tmp = subset(clim, clim$day==20 & clim$month==2 
             & clim$year < 1950)
tmp

# generate R understandable dates
clim$date = as.Date(paste(clim$day, clim$month, clim$year, sep="/"),"%d/%m/%Y")

# look at the file
View(clim)
# see some summary statistics of the columns
summary(clim)

# create a new table that summarizes by wateryear, use mean for state variables, and sum for flux variables
# this uses functions from the dplyr package
a = clim %>% select(wy,month,tmax, tmin) %>% group_by(wy, month) %>% 
    summarize_each(funs(mean))
   
b = clim %>% select(wy,month,rain) %>% group_by(wy, month) %>% 
    summarize_each(funs(sum))

# link data sets together (automatically uses shared colums)   
clim.mwy = inner_join(a,b)
head(clim.mwy)


#add a new variable
clim$tavg = (clim$tmin+clim$tmax)/2
range(clim$tavg)
range(clim$tmin)
range(clim$tmax)

plot(clim$date, clim$tmax, type="l", col="red", ylab="Max Daily T (C)")

boxplot(clim.mwy$rain~clim.mwy$month, ylab="Monthly Rainfall (mm)", 
        xlab="Month", col=clim.mwy$month)


```




# Git - how to use version control with your project

R studio links nicely with git; you can use git to track changes both locally and in the remote repository

Lets start by assuming you've set up the project as described above

## Tracking things locally with git

* Check on the file you want to stage
* Commit
     * This will create your master branch
* Make a change to a file
* Use diff to see what changed 
     * you must save the file first
* Commit changes
* Use history to see how things have changed 
* Repeat as you change things

## Saving to your global github (for sharing)

* Make sure you have committed all recent changes
* get the http **address** from your github repo
* Open a shell in Git tab in Rstudio

type

*git remote add origin* **address**  

*git push -u origin master*

* Notice how now under the Git tab you have colored arrows, you can now use these to push and pull from github to your local repo

* now make a local change and use these to update your github repo

* look at your repo online to see what you've done

* notice how now in git commit  it will also track your branch in comparison with remote repo
